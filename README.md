# Weather List Component Challenge

## Task
Create a Weather List Component that:
- Fetches data from `/weather.json` (already provided in `public/weather.json`).
- Displays **city name**, **temperature in °C**, **condition text**, and **icon**.
- Uses a **placeholder icon** if no icon URL is provided.
- Allows **search filtering** by city name.
- Sorts the list alphabetically by city.

## Requirements
1. Fetch weather data on mount.
2. Show loading and error states.
3. Render the list in a clean, responsive design.
4. Implement a search filter and alphabetical sorting.
5. Ensure good code quality and readability.

## Bonus (Optional)
- Add unit tests for search & sort logic.
- Add dark mode support.
- Debounce search input for performance.

**Time Suggestion:** 45–60 min.

Good luck!
